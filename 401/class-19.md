# Automation

The 'shutil' module is central to file system automations.  In concert with other standad library modules, it provides the tools to manipulate the file system.

To automate web page tasks, a python module called Selenium is helpful.

For apps, not web pages, automation centers on controlling the mouse and keyboard.  A python module called pyautogui focuses on this area.

### Shutil

Part of Python's standard library, the 'Shutil' module allows us to conduct high-level file operations:
- copy files
  - copyfile()
  - copy()
  - copy2()
- work with directories
  - copytree()
  - rmtree()
  - move() -file or directory
- finding files
  - which()
- archive
  - make_archive()
  - unpack_archive()
- check system space
  - disk_usage()

### Bonus: Python Regular Expressions

Regular Expressions (regex) are character sequences used to check patterns and conduct operations on text strings.

Python, as part of its standard library, has a built-in Regular Expressions module 're', which includes helpful functions including match(), compile(), search(), findall(), sub(), and split() among others.

Note: Regular Expressions are 'greedy' by default.

Regular Expressions are concise and powerful but use a different syntax than you might be used to.  Be wary of long, confusing expressions that are hard to understand and maintain.

To learn about Regular Expressions see the tutorial in the Resources section below.  It is a good tutorial.  However, learn Regular Expressions,make sure you practice!
