# Matplotlib
> Matplotlib is probably the single most used Python package for 2D-graphics. It provides both a very quick way to visualize data from Python and publication-quality figures in many formats.

> Pyplot provides a convenient interface to the matplotlib object-oriented plotting library.

Matplotlib allow you to customize the defaults of almost every property, e.g. size, line width, color, style, axes, etc...

#### Subplots
With subplot, arrange plots in a grid by specifying the number of rows and columns and the order of the plot. Note: the gridspec command is a more powerful alternative.

#### Axes
> Axes are very similar to subplots but allow placement of plots at any location in the figure. So if we want to put a smaller plot inside a bigger one we do so with axes.

### Seaborn
> Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

Seaborn's  plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays. It internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots. This helps you focus on data analysis, rather than on how to plot it.

Full customization of graphics requires some knowledge of Matplotlib.  Knowing when to use the matplotlib layer is necessary to achieve a particular customization is part of the learning curve of Seaborn.


### Bokeh
> Bokeh is an interactive visualization library for modern web browsers. It provides elegant, concise construction of versatile graphics, and affords high-performance interactivity over large or streaming datasets. Bokeh can help anyone who would like to quickly and easily make interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications.
