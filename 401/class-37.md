# React 1

### ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview

The resource 'ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview' below is an excellent quick-refresh guide to JavaScrip.

### React Refresher

The React resources below provide a comprehensive refresh of React basics with examples.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind uses a Utility-First approach to CSS.  It allow us to implement a completely custom component design without writing a single line of custom CSS.

Instead of large CSS files with numerous classes and ids to style different elements, Tailwind uses predefined utility classes directly into each component as needed.

The benefits of this approach are:
- No need to invent class names
- CSS stops growing
- Making changes is safer

The approach is similar to inline style, but with some important differences:
- Style within constratints
- Responsive style
- Hover, focus, and other states can be managed

Maintainability concerns
Managing commonly repeated utility combinations may be done by extracting components and partials, and using editor and language features like multi-cursor editing and loops.

### Next.js

Next.js, the React Framework, enhaces development work by taking care of imporant details of building React web applications:

- An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
- Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
- Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
- Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
- Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
- Development environment with Fast Refresh support
- API routes to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
- Fully extendable
