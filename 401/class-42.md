# Pythonisms

### Dunder Methods

Dunder Methods are special methods you can use to enrich your classes:

- Initialization of new objects
- Object representation
- Enable iteration
- Operator overloading (comparison)
- Operator overloading (addition)
- Method invocation
- Context manager support (with statement)

### Iterators

> Understanding iterators is a milestone for any serious Pythonista

Iterators work by calling the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods in sequence.

The iteration ends when the last element is reached, in which case the next iteration raises StopIteration.

### Generators

> Generator functions are syntactic sugar for writing objects that support the iterator protocol. Generators abstract away much of the boilerplate code needed when writing class-based iterators.

> Calling a generator function doesnâ€™t even run the function. It merely creates and returns a generator object

Instead of a return statement, generators use a yield statement that suspends the function and retains its local state.
