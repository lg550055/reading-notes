Structured Query Language (SQL) is a search language to instruct a relational database what information to retrieve.

* There are many popular SQL databases including SQLite, MySQL, Postgres, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. All of them support the SQL language standard. *

Information is organized into tables.

SELECT is the first instruction of any SQL statement thatâ€™s fetching data.

Each query needs to end in a semi-colon.

FROM

SELECT [column] FROM [table];

/* Splat is a shortcut to get all columns.

ORDER BY [desired column]
