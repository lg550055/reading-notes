# JavaScript basics
> JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted programming language with first-class functions. While mostly known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, e.g. Node.js.

> Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both "Java" and "JavaScript" are trademarks of Oracle. However, they have very different syntax, semantics, and use.
