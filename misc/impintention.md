# Implementation Intention

It's a commitment to yourself to follow through on something. Typically, it follows the format "During the next week, I will partake in at least [MINUTES] of [ACTIVITY] on [DAY] at [TIME OF DAY] at/in [PLACE]."

The simple step of writing down when, where, and how you plan on reaching your goal can have an incredibly powerful effect and make it much more likely that you follow through and take action on your plans.

Setting implementation intentions is one of the easiest and most effective ways to increase your odds of successfully reaching your goals.
