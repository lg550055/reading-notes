Working in teams has been a critical part of humanity from the beggining, in my opinion.

Research shows people in well-functioning teams are:
- happier
- more productive
- more innovative

Well-functioning teams have:
- good communication
- no micromanaging
- **healthy group norms**
  - regulate how teammates treat one another
  - may raise the group's intelligence
  - balanced distribution of conversational turn-taking
  - high ‘average social sensitivity’, which skilled at intuiting how others felt based on their tone of voice, their expressions and other nonverbal cues
  - psychological safety
