# HTML Lists, CSS Boxes & JS Control Flow

## HTML Lists
Lists are a very common HTML element; there are three types of lists:

- Ordered lists `<ol></ol>` contain numbered `<li>` elements
- Unordered lists `<ul></ul>` -contain bullets `<li>` elements
- Definition lists `<dl></dl>` -contain terms `<dt>` and definition `<dd>` elements

#### Ordered and Unordered lists are the most common

#### Lists can be nested inside another list

## CSS Boxes
> CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.

One can set:
- the dimensions of a box
- borders and their properties
- margin and padding

#### Use `width` and `height` to set box dimensions
Along with min and max, e.g. `max-width`


#### Control borders with the following properties
- `border-width`
- `border-style`
- `border-color`

***Use `border: [width] [style] [color]` to combine all three into a single line


#### Margin `margin` adds space between boxes

#### Padding `padding` adds space between the border and the content of the element

## JS Control Flow
Is the order in which statements are executed

***Code runs in order from the first line to the last line, unless there is, for example, a conditional or loop, which happens all the time.***

Examples of flow control elements:
- If else
- Switch (which are similar to if else)
- Exception types like `thorw` and `try`
- For loops
- While loops
