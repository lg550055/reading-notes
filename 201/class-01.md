# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

Web pages are at the core of the internet.

> HTML describes the structure of a web page:

- Sturcture helps the audience understand content
- Online and offline content structure is similar!
- HTML code lives inside angle brackets
- Each line of code encompassed by these brackets is called an HTML element, e.g. `<h1>This is a Heading element</h1>`
- Elements are usually encompased an opening tag and a closing tag, which has an extra forward slash `/` in it
- Tags are like containers, which tells you something about the content they encompass

### Basic HTML document stucture
There are three high level elements in all HTML pages:

- A web page begins with a DOCTYPE declaration (usually `<!DOCTYPE html>` to tell the browser which version of HTML the page uses
- An HTML page resides inside `<html> </html>` tags
- Inside of these you'll find one set of `<head></head>` tags and one set of `<body></body>`

##### To learn HTML it's important ot understand tags

- Tags are often called elements
- Tags usually come in pairs (opening and closing)
- Opening tags can have *attributes*, which provide additional info about the element's content
- Attributes require a name and a value `name="value"`

##### Examples of common tags

- The `<div>` and `<span>` elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements
- `<iframes>` allow you to display other pages in your page, for example a google map or a youtube video
- The `<meta>` tag, located in the `<head>` element allows you to supply information to search engines

### HTML5 semantic elements
Semantic elements make it easy to indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and hels shape its structure; they make the code clearer

##### Examples of semantic elements
- Header
- Nav
- Section
- Article
- Aside
- Footer
