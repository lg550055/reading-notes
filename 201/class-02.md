# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS
HTML, CSS and JS are the three basic pillars of a web page.  The HTML discussion focuses on text!

## HTML Text
HTML tags can be grouped into two categories

- There's one Paragraph tag `<p>` and 6 Headings, from most to least prominent:
  - `<h1>`
  - `<h2>`
  - `<h3>`
  - `<h4>`
  - `<h5>`
  - `<h6>`
- Semantic information, which add emphasis, quotes, etc:
  - Bold `<strong>`
  - Italics `<em>`
  - Quotes `<q>`
  - Cite `<cite>`


## Intro CSS
CSS helps you make content appear pretty and interesting

> The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.

Keep in mind that *block* elements take the whole line, while *inline* elements float with the text

> CSS associates style rules with HTML elements
CSS rules have to two parts:
- a **selector**, indicates the subject element, and
- a **declaration**, dictates the style; and sit inside curly braces containing:
    - a **property**
    - a **value**

#### CSS rules can be in three places, most commonly in a separate file (external)

- Inline: inside the opening tag of each subject element
- Internal: in the `<head>` element
- Externat: separate file referenced in the `<head>` element
