# Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts

1. What is functional programming?  Is programmin by using pure functions (instead of, for example, manipulating objects).  It decomposes the problem into functions.  It focuses on results, as opposed to process.  It aims to keed data unmutable.
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?  Has no side effects and returns the same result given the same arguments.
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?  They don't affect other parts of our system.  They are easier to test.  And make code easier to understand.
4. What is immutability?  Not changing.  Objects are not altered.
5. What is Referential transparency?  Is the ability to replace an expresion by it output without changing the result of the programm.  (Referential transparency = pure functions + immutable data)
