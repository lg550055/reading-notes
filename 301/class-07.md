# REST

## Biref intro to REST

1. Who is Roy Fielding?  A smart guy who helped write the HTTP protocol to create the first internet servers.  A protocol is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world.
2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?  Because they were built to primarily talk one machine, and not to all the machines.
3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?  It combines the location of a resource, URL, with an action like GET (or other actions) to transfer information.
4. What does a GET do?  Retrieves information.
5. What does a POST do?  Adds information.
6. What does PUT do?  Replaces information.
7. What does PATCH do?  Partially updates information.
