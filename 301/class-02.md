# State and Props

## React Lifecycle
1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?  Render
2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?  Mounting: constructor
3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates
  - constructor
  - render
  - componentDidMount
  - React Updates
  - componentWillUnmount
4. What does componentDidMount do?  Load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM

## State Vs Props
1. What types of things can you pass in the props?  Arguments to a function
2. What is the big difference between props and state?  Props are passed into a component as read-only, state is inside and handled/changed in the component
3. When do we re-render our application?  When state changes
4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?  Attribute values of objects, e.g. DOM elements
