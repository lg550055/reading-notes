# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

## That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
> For decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. But in 1984, something changed. The percentage of women in computer science flattened, and then plunged, even as the share of women in other technical and professional fields kept rising.
The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.  PCs were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.  The idea that computers are for boys became the narrative.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
Because they acquired knowledge that was later on assumed to be a trait of those interested in computer science, all of which reinforced the narrative cycle.

## Employee breakdown of key technology companies

1. What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?
Tech, the top 50 US companies and the US congress have a significant under-representation of women, latino and black individuals.
At these tech companies (https://informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/diversity-in-tech/), women account for about 33%, latinos 5-6%, and blacks 3-4%, while whites account for about 50%, and assians 30-40%.  In comparison, among the us population, whites account for 61%, asians 6%, latinos 18% and blacks 13%; women 51%.  Thus, for each group to be proportinately represented, women's share would have to increase by 33%, latinos by 300%, blacks by 400%, whites by 20%.

## Why diversity matters to your tech company

1. When are diversity efforts most successful? When driven by a commitment from company leaders.
2. Why do diverse companies perform better?  Because diverse teams are smarter and more creative. Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it.
3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.  When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result.  When Tracy Chou of Pinterest shared the company’s demographic information last year, she explained: "We only stand to improve the quality and impact of our products if the people building them are representative of the user base and reflect the same diversity of demography, culture, life experiences and interests that makes our community so vibrant."
