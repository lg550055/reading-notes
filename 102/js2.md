# Programming with JavaScript
Programming with JS is fun!

### Control Flow

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless there is a conditional or a loop, which there usually are!

#### Common control structures that alter flow

- Conditionals, e.g. if, else
- Loops, e.g. for
- Functions


##### Functions
> A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

###### Function Syntax - `myFunctionName(parameters) {code}`

- Functions begin with the keywork `function`
- Followed by a name in camelCase
- Followed by parenthesis enclosing zero or more parameters
- Followed by curly braces enclosing the function's code

###### Function Invocation

>The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

- An event occurs, e.g. a user clicks a button
- When invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- Automatically (self invoked)

*The () operatior invokes the function"

###### Function Return

When a function reaches a `return` statement, it stops running and passes any return value to the "caller"
