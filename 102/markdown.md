## 2. Markdown Basics
> Simple way to add content to a webpage

In Markdown, a few selectors allow us to format text.  
for example:
- Use # to format as a large heading and ## for a slightly smaller heading; all the way down to 6 #
- Encompas text in * for italics, ** for bold, and *** for bold italics
    > This **bold text** has two * before and after
- To make an unorder list beging the line with -, for an ordered list begin with 1. 
    > Each line of this lists begins with - and space
- For a quote, begin the line with >
- To add a horizontal line (like the one below the title of this page) type *** on a single line
- To make a set of words a clickable link use enclose the set in square brackets immediately followed by the url enclosed in parenthesis
- Enclose in angle brackets a url or email to make it a clickable link
